        <h2><center>Social Media Safety<center></h2>
        <p>Social media platforms are a great way to connect with others, but they come with their own set of risks.
Avoid Sharing Location Details
Refrain from posting your real-time location, especially public check-ins,
as it may compromise your privacy and safety.

Verify Friend Requests
Be cautious when accepting friend or follow requests.
Scammers often create fake profiles to gain access to personal information.

Be Mindful of What You Post
Think twice before posting. Once something is online, it can be difficult
to fully remove, even if you delete it later.

Beware of Clickbait and Malicious Links
Avoid clicking on suspicious links or ads that seem too good to be true,
as they might lead to phishing websites or malware downloads.

Regularly Monitor Account Activity
Frequently check your account for unfamiliar logins or suspicious activity.
Report and secure your account immediately if you notice anything unusual. Here are some tips to stay safe:</p>

            <tr><th>Tip</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Limit Sharing Personal Information</td><td>Do not share sensitive personal information like your address, phone number, or financial details.</td></tr>

        <h2><center>Online Scams<center></h2>
        <p>Online scams can take many forms, from fraudulent emails to fake websites.<br>
Romance Scams.....<br>

Scammers may pose as potential romantic partners on dating websites or apps to gain your trust and eventually ask for money. Always verify their authenticity before engaging deeply.<br>
Job Offer Scams.....<br>

Be wary of unsolicited job offers promising high salaries with minimal effort. Scammers often request upfront payments for training or equipment.<br>
Lottery or Prize Scams.....<br>

You may receive messages claiming you’ve won a lottery or prize, but they require you to pay fees or share personal details. Genuine lotteries don’t ask for money upfront.<br>
Overpayment Scams.....<br>

Scammers might "overpay" for a product or service and request a refund of the excess. These payments are often fake, leaving you at a loss.<br>
Investment Scams.....<br>

Fraudsters offer fake investment opportunities with guaranteed high returns. Always research and verify the legitimacy of investment platforms. Stay alert to avoid falling victim:</p>

        <p>Cyber attacks are attempts to harm or break into systems, networks, or devices without permission. Common examples include phishing, where attackers trick people into sharing personal information, and ransomware, which locks your data until you pay money. Another example is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which floods a website with too much traffic so it stops working. To protect yourself, use strong passwords, turn on two-step verification, and keep your software updated. Avoid clicking on unknown links or emails, and always back up your important files. Being careful and staying informed can help keep you safe.
Cyber attacks come in various forms. Understanding the types can help you stay protected:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Attack Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Prevention</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Phishing</td><td>Attempts to steal personal information by pretending to be a trustworthy source.</td><td>Be cautious with emails and links from unknown sources.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ransomware</td><td>Malware that locks your data and demands a ransom to unlock it.</td><td>Backup data and avoid clicking on suspicious links.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Denial of Service (DoS)</td><td>An attack that floods a server with traffic, making it unavailable.</td><td>Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to prevent attacks.</td></tr>
